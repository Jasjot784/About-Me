    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Jasjot Singh.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like developing apps, too. Raw apps. Grilled apps. Smoked apps. Poached apps - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go firebasing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large android app with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own app.
\nYou should ask someone else about developing apps, though.\n\n</string>
